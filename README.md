# ContourVision: Automated Object Boundary Detection

## 📌 Project Description

ContourVision is a Python-based image processing tool that detects object contours in images using OpenCV. This project utilizes edge detection and contour extraction techniques to identify and highlight object boundaries, particularly effective for circular and well-defined objects.

## 🚀 Features

- Automatic contour detection using OpenCV
- Canny edge detection for precise boundary extraction
- Support for color-based object segmentation (HSV thresholding)
- Customizable parameters for optimized results
- Simple and efficient implementation

## 📷 Example Output

| Original Image | Canny Edges | Detected Contours |
| -------------- | ----------- | ----------------- |
| ![Original](original.jpg) | ![Edges](canny_edges.jpg) | ![Contours](contour_detected.jpg) |

## 📥 Installation

Ensure you have Python and OpenCV installed. Install dependencies using:
```sh
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib
```

## ⚙️ System Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization, optional)

## 🔍 Use Cases

- Shape detection in image processing
- Object tracking in real-time applications
- Pre-processing for machine learning models
- Industrial automation for defect detection

## 🔧 Customization

You can tweak the following parameters for better results:

- **Canny Edge Thresholds**: Adjust values to control edge sensitivity.
- **Blur Kernel Size**: Change kernel size to reduce noise.
- **Contour Retrieval Mode**: Use different modes to capture nested contours.

## 📊 Performance & Accuracy

- Works well for high-contrast objects
- May require fine-tuning for noisy backgrounds
- Can be improved using adaptive thresholding or deep learning integration

## 📝 Future Improvements

- Integration with deep learning models for better contour accuracy
- Real-time contour detection with webcam support
- Enhanced noise reduction techniques
